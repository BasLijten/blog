Welcome to my new blog! I had to make a move to a new domain and CMS, because my old host wasn't able to fullfill the requirements that I had. This blog doesn't contain all posts yet, but they will be migrated at a later time.

Changes so far:

- Moved from my old blog (on bloggingabout.net) to http://blog.baslijten.com
- a lot of SEO improvements
- move from telligent community server to wordpress (that's right, no SharePoint)
- and last but not least, a complete new redesign

Update: migrating posts is hell of a job... but someone has got to do it :(
