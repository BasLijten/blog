After years of organizing internal techdays, On the 17th of March 2022, Achmea will organize its first Techday which will be accessible for everyone who is interested! This day will be in **Dutch**, so it might be hard to follow for people who don't speak dutch. We have selected the following 4 sessions.

- _Developing a Distributed architecture using DAPR and Project Tye_ - Robert Jan van Holland & Bas Lijten
- _Containers zijn de toekomst: maar hoe ziet dat er dan uit?_ - Erik van Weert
- _Voorspelmodellen operationaliseren in Azure en Openshift_ - Ari Sadik & Dirk Meewis
- \*Hoe ontwikkel je een chatbot die echt werkt?" - Badal Marhé & René van de Ven

## Developing a Distributed architecture using DAPR and Project Tye

I am just going to highlight my own session ;) In this session, Robert Jan and I are going to elaborate how we are using [DAPR](https://dapr.io) and [Project Tye](https://github.com/dotnet/tye) in our architecture. DAPR is the Distributed Application Runtime and allows to simplify microservices connectivity. It allows to keep focus on business logic and keep your code as simple as possible. Project tye is tooling that makes developing, testing and deploying microservices/distributed applications easier. A third component is a custom gateway, which allows to run several micro-frontends, based on different technologystacks, next to each other, without having any issues in terms of security, authentication or sessions.
